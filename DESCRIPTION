Description: A set of functions to build a scoring model from beginning to end, leading the user
    to follow an efficient and organized development process, reducing significantly the time
    spent on data exploration, variable selection, feature engineering, binning and model selection 
    among other recurrent tasks. 
    The package also incorporates monotonic and customized binning, scaling capabilities that 
    transforms logistic coefficients into points for a better business understanding and 
    calculates and visualizes classic performance metrics of a classification model.
